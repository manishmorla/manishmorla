👋 Hello, I'm Manish Morla
Aspiring Full-Stack ML Engineer | Java Backend Developer

I'm a final-year B.Tech Computer Science Engineering student at KPRIET with a strong passion for building scalable backend systems and deploying machine learning models to production. I specialize in Java backend development, Spring Boot, RESTful APIs, and full-stack ML applications, and I am actively seeking entry-level Software Developer / ML Engineer roles where I can build efficient systems and impactful AI solutions.

🧠 What I Do
🔧 Backend Development: Design and build scalable RESTful APIs and backend services using Java, Spring Boot, and Flask, with a focus on clean architecture and maintainable code.

🤖 ML Engineering: Develop end-to-end ML pipelines including preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment for image, text, and tabular data.

🌐 Full-Stack ML Apps: Create end-to-end web applications that integrate ML models into production-ready interfaces using Flask, HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.

📊 Data & Analytics: Work with data processing libraries to clean, transform, and analyze datasets, optimizing models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

🚀 Highlighted Projects
🗑️ ML-Waste-Classification – Full-Stack ML Waste Management App
GitHub: https://github.com/manishmorla/ML-Waste-classification-

Built an intelligent waste classification system that predicts whether waste images are organic or non-organic using a Random Forest Classifier with image preprocessing.

Developed a responsive dark-themed web UI with drag-and-drop upload, real-time confidence scores, and integrated Flask RESTful APIs with health check and model status endpoints.

Tech: Python, Flask, scikit-learn, scikit-image, NumPy, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+, async/await)

🩺 Health & Co – AI-Powered Personalized Nutrition Advisor
GitHub: https://github.com/manishmorla/Health-Co

Created a personalized nutrition recommendation system using Google Gemini AI to provide health and dietary advice based on BMI, age, gender, health conditions, and eating habits.

Implemented dual interfaces (Streamlit web app + CLI), automated BMI calculation, dietary habit analysis, and interactive Q&A with an AI assistant.

Tech: Python, Streamlit, Google Gemini AI API, python-dotenv

🧵 Hybrid CNN-DNN Cyberbullying Detection System
Implemented an end-to-end NLP pipeline for abusive language detection using TF-IDF with 1-gram and 2-gram features on noisy, multilingual social media text.

Trained CNN-DNN ensemble models with class-imbalance handling and evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
