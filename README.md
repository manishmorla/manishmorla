Hello, I'm Manish Morla

Aspiring Full-Stack ML Engineer & Backend Developer

I'm a final-year B.Tech student in Computer Science Engineering with strong expertise in backend development, machine learning, and scalable software systems. I build intelligent, data-driven applications using Java, Spring Boot, Python, and modern ML frameworks. Passionate about creating practical solutions that combine AI innovation with real-world applications.

What I Do

Backend Development: Build robust, scalable RESTful APIs and systems using Java, Spring Boot, Hibernate, and SQL databases.

AI/ML Engineering: Develop and deploy machine learning models and NLP pipelines using Python, TensorFlow, and Scikit-learn.

Full-Stack Integration: Create end-to-end applications, integrating ML models into production-ready systems.

Data Solutions: Design databases, optimize queries, and implement data workflows for analytics and automation.
